# Sudoku-Game-With-Hint-
Console-based sudoku game with hints. As if we are stuck during playing a game we can use the hint section at most 3 times.

Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column, and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column, or square.

In this project, we add most importantly -
1) HINT(MAX 3 Times)
2) ERASE 

If we want to erase the entered digit then go to erase part (as many times you can) similarly for a hint(at most 3 times).
